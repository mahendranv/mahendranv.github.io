HiðŸ‘‹,  

I'm Mahendran, based in south India. I love developing mobile apps and exploring frameworks. Have experience in Xamarin and developed few chatbots and Alexa skills. 
    
ðŸš€
 Flutter, vue.js & react are the few frameworks that I started and evetually lost touch.
 Currently hacking with GraphQL / SpringBoot and Jetpack Compose.
