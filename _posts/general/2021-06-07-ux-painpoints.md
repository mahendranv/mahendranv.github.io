I love UX engineers — they take away the hardest task that devs would otherwise stuck scratching their heads. Designing the mock and picking colors. However, in some cases I end up arguing with them over few things that I listed below.

## Mobile screen real estate is limited

### John Doe is not the only name
In multiple occurances, designers go with short and sweet names when mocking some user info. But in reality, the names could get long n'long and the layout might stretch or names ellipsized. We don't have to go all the way up to support [Hubert Blaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Blaine_Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff_Sr.), but keep a favorite 20-30 char length name when designing the layout and use it.

## Table vs Lists
In a desktop/tablet there is enough screen real estate to present a table without the need of horizontal scroll. If we take a same approach, mobile will push content off the screen and will endup with scroll bars on each direction. So, unless the content qualifies as an Excel sheet or a [data table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/#live-demo), pick few columns, arrange it, throw few icons in and build a list item.



## App navigation is different from websites


## Consistency is key
## Avoid quicktour — study the platform

## Make sure colors have semantic names
## Hiding status bar is not gonna do any good
## User don't click with mouse
